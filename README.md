# BubblePop
BubblePop! is a simple iOS game developed using the Swift programming language. BubblePop! is available free on the App Store.

## Functionality Specification   
In this game, a number of bubbles are randomly displayed on an iOS device screen. A player pops a
bubble by touching the bubble, and every time they pop a bubble they earn a certain number of
points. Bubbles come in five colours: red, pink, green, blue and black. Each colour corresponds
to a specific number of points and has a specific probability of appearance. All bubbles appear on 
the screen briefly. A player needs to pop as many bubbles as possible within a certain timeframe 
(default to 60 seconds) to get high scores. Note that, if a player pops two or more bubbles of the 
same colour consecutively, they earn 1.5 times the points for the additional bubbles they pop. 
Finally, game scores are saved and a high score board is displayed after a game run is finished.
